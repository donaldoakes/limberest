  You're a Java developer and you aim to quickly spin up and host a REST API.
  <ol>
    <li>Add <code>implements Jsonable</code> to your Java model class(es)
      <ul>
        <li>This gives you easily-customizable <a href="topics/binding">autobinding</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Extend <a href="javadoc/io/limberest/json/JsonRestService">JsonRestService</a> to create your service
      <ul>
        <li>Use JAX-RS <code>@Path</code> annotations to <a href="topics/services">declare your endpoints</a></li>
        <li>Implement <code>get()</code>, <code>post()</code>, <code>put()</code>, and/or <code>delete()</code>
        <li>Optionally add Swagger annotations for auto-generated <a href="topics/swagger">API docs</a>
          and <a href="topics/validation">validation</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

You know JavaScript, and you want to build automated tests to exercise your API.
  <ol>
    <li>Export a <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections">Postman collection</a> that has the
    parameterized requests that'll form the basis of your test cases
      <ul>
        <li>
          Runtime <a href="topics/testing#values">values</a> are supplied by standard JSON object files, or can be assigned through script
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Write a <a href="topics/testing#cases">test case</a> that orchestrates requests
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every run produces a highly-readable <a href="topics/testing#results">YAML result</a> file
        </li>
        <li>
          Expected results are compared versus actual to determine test case success

    <h3>Lightweight</h3>
    <p>
    Everything in Limberest exists to help you build a service API.
    Bring your own model, persistence, UI and container.  Limberest is not trying to be a platform.
    <a href="dependencies">Dependencies</a> are scant.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet Limberest has everything you need to get up and running quickly.
    Read through the <a href="topics/">documentation</a>, or jump straight to the
    fully-baked implementation in <a href="https://github.com/limberest/limberest-demo">limberest-demo</a>.
    </p>   
  </div>
  <div class="home-col">
    <h3>Flexible</h3>
    <p>
    Limberest can be deployed in a variety of ways; from a straight-up jar dependency, to
    a self-contained, prebuilt War distribution.  You can integrate <a href="topics/testing">Limberest Tests</a> into your build cycle through
    the our <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/limberest-ui">GitHub App</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    While Limberest is naturally geared to channel you toward a hypermedia constrained approach, your services
    can adopt whatever pattern makes sense to you.  You exercise low-level control by implementing the HTTP method
    verbs directly.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="home-col">
    <h3>Elegant</h3>
    <p>
    REST is meant to be simple and cohesive.  Why introduce a framework that makes it complicated?
    You'll be amazed at how little implementation it takes to <a href="topics/services">expose a service</a> with Limberest.
    </p>
    <p>
    Simplicity is especially apparent in Limberest's approach to JSON <a href="topics/binding">object binding</a>.
    To override the defaults you don't need to inject any convoluted mapping mechanism; rather you'll employ an
    intuitive object inheritance pattern.
