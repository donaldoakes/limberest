    <h3>Lightweight</h3>
    <p>
    Everything in Limberest exists to help you build a service API.
    Bring your own model, persistence, UI and container.  Limberest is not trying to be a platform.
    <a href="dependencies">Dependencies</a> are scant and unlikely to conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet Limberest has everything you need to get up and running quickly.
    Follow the <a href="cookbook/">cookbook</a> to walk through the steps, or jump straight to the
    fully-baked implementation in <a href="demo/">limberest-demo</a>.
    </p>   
  </div>
  <div class="home-col">
    <h3>Flexible</h3>
    <p>
    Limberest can be deployed in a variety of ways; from a straight-up jar dependency, to
    a self-contained, prebuilt War distribution.  There are even fully-hosted ecosystems available (todo: ref).
    </p>
    <p>
    While Limberest is naturally geared to channel you toward a hypermedia constrained approach, your services
    can adopt whatever pattern makes sense to you.  You exercise low-level control by implementing the HTTP method
    verbs directly.
    </p>

  <div class="home-col">
    <h3>Elegant</h3>
    <p>
    REST is meant to be simple and cohesive.  Why introduce a framework that makes it complicated?
    You'll be amazed at how little implementation it takes to <a href="topics/services">expose a service</a> with Limberest.
    </p>
    <p>
    Simplicity is especially apparent in Limberest's approach to JSON <a href="topics/binding">object binding</a>.
    To override the defaults you don't need to inject any convoluted mapping mechanism; rather you'll employ an
    intuitive object inheritance pattern.
