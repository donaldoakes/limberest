    You're a Java developer and you aim to quickly spin up and host a REST API.
    <ol>
      <li>Add <code>implements Jsonable</code> to your Java model class(es)
        <ul>
          <li>This gives you easily-customizable <a href="topics/binding">autobinding</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Extend <a href="javadoc/io/limberest/json/JsonRestService">JsonRestService</a> to create your service
        <ul>
          <li>Use JAX-RS <code>@Path</code> annotations to <a href="topics/services">declare your endpoints</a></li>
          <li>Implement <code>get()</code>, <code>post()</code>, <code>put()</code>, and/or <code>delete()</code>
          <li>Optionally, add Swagger annotations for auto-generated <a href="topics/swagger">API docs</a>
            and <a href="topics/validation">validation</a></li>

    <h3>Lightweight</h3>
    <p>
    Everything in Limberest exists to help you build a service API.
    Bring your own model, persistence, UI and container.  Limberest is not trying to be a platform.
    <a href="dependencies">Dependencies</a> are scant.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet Limberest has everything you need to get up and running quickly.
    Read through the <a href="topics/components">documentation</a>, or jump straight to the
    fully-baked implementation in <a href="https://github.com/limberest/limberest-demo">limberest-demo</a>.
    </p>   
  </div>
  <div class="home-col">
    <h3>Flexible</h3>
    <p>
    Limberest can be deployed in a variety of ways; from a straight-up jar dependency in a webapp destined
    for Tomcat or Jetty, to a <a href="topics/spring-boot">Spring Boot dependency</a> in your self-contained executable jar.
    </p>
    <p>
    While Limberest is naturally geared to channel you toward a hypermedia constrained approach, your services
    can adopt whatever pattern makes sense to you.  You exercise low-level control by implementing the HTTP method
    verbs directly.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="home-col">
    <h3>Elegant</h3>
    <p>
    REST is meant to be simple and cohesive.  Why introduce a framework that makes it complicated?
    You'll be amazed at how little implementation it takes to <a href="topics/services">expose a service</a> with Limberest.
    </p>
    <p>
    Simplicity is especially apparent in Limberest's approach to JSON <a href="topics/binding">object binding</a>.
    To override the defaults you don't need to inject any convoluted mapping mechanism; rather you'll employ an
    intuitive object inheritance pattern.
